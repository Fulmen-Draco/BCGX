### Summary of Financial Chatbot

#### Overview
The financial chatbot is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist users with financial queries related to specific companies and fiscal years. It reads data from two CSV files (`bcg.csv` for detailed financial reports and `summ.csv` for summary reports) to provide accurate responses to user inquiries.

#### How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users initiate a session by typing "Hi". The chatbot then prompts them to select a company from a predefined list (Microsoft, Tesla, Apple) and enter a fiscal year (2021, 2022, or 2023).
2. **Data Input**: Users enter their query about the selected company's financial data for the specified fiscal year.
3. **Response Generation**: The chatbot processes the query, extracts relevant data from the CSV files, and returns the requested information.

#### Predefined Queries
The chatbot can respond to the following queries:
1. "What is the total revenue?"
2. "What is the Net Income?"
3. "What is the sum of total assets?"
4. "What is the sum of total liabilities?"
5. "What is cash flow from operating activities?"
6. "What is the revenue growth(%)?"
7. "What is the net income growth(%)?"
8. "What is the assets growth(%)?"
9. "What is the liabilities growth(%)?"
10. "What is the cash flow from operations growth(%)?"
11. "What is the year by year average revenue growth rate(%)?"
12. "What is the year by year average net income growth rate(%)?"
13. "What is the year by year average assets growth rate(%)?"
14. "What is the year by year average liabilities growth rate(%)?"
15. "What is the year by year average cash flow from operations growth rate(%)?"

#### Limitations
1. **Limited Companies and Years**: The chatbot can only provide information for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple, and only for the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023.
2. **Fixed Queries**: The chatbot is limited to the predefined set of queries listed above. It cannot handle questions outside this scope.
3. **Case Sensitivity and Input Validation**: Users must enter valid company names and fiscal years exactly as specified. Incorrect inputs will prompt error messages.
4. **Static Data**: The chatbot relies on static CSV files, so it cannot provide real-time updates or information outside the scope of these files.

This chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for accessing key financial data and growth metrics for specified companies and years, making it a valuable tool for quick financial insights.
